# 2048 Clone

This is a clone of the popular game 2048, built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

The game is a single-page application that allows you to play 2048 right in your browser. The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys (or A W S D) to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!
